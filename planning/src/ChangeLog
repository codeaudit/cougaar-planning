	* org/cougaar/planning/plugin/deletion/TaskDeletionPlugin.java:
	Refactored version of the old DeletionPlugin. Non-planning
	specific code has been moved to DeletionPlugin in core. This
	plugin extends the core DeletionPlugin to provide for the deletion
	of Tasks (and PlanElements). This code is untested at this time.

	* org/cougaar/planning/plugin/deletion/DeletionPolicyBase.java:
	An implementation of DeletionPolicy based on the Policy class.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/RemoteAllocationLP.java:
	Bug #3266 -- Commitment time of tasks are not copied to remote allocation task
	Copy the commitment data from original task to remote task if it
	is not null.

2003-08-21  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/planning/servlet/CompletionServlet.java:
	Bug #3241 -- Stacktrace in completion servlet
	Formatting integers into a too-narrow space attempts to construct
	padding with a negative number of spaces leading to an exception.
	Check for negative padding and return do not pad in that case.
	Also check for attempts to add too much padding. The latter
	shouldn't happen, but while we are being paranoid...

	* org/cougaar/planning/servlet/CompletionServlet.java:
	Bug #2912 -- GLMCompletion servlet URIs too long
	Use POST instead of GET. The alternative is to use sessions, but
	that is a bigger change.
	Changed the one POST that might get redirected (where the action
	specifies a different agent) back to GET. This form has no hidden
	selectedAgent inputs and so should have a limited length.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/RemoteAllocationLP.java:
	Bug #2889 -- RemoteAllocationLP end date check affects the execution optempo perturbation
	Offset the minValidTaskTime by VALID_TASK_TIME_OFFSET of one day.
	Tasks with an end time preference more than one day in the past
	are not sent to other agents.

2003-05-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/planning/servlet/PlanViewServlet.java:
	Add sort by end time option for tasks. Also added preferences
	column to task display and reformatted phrases column to improve
	readability.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/RemoteAllocationLP.java:
	Additional logging.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/ReceiveTaskLP.java:
	Compare phrases, context, and verb of received tasks and update
	the task if any of these have changed. Also add more logging.

	* org/cougaar/planning/plugin/asset/AssetDataPlugin.java:
	Fix deprecation warning by using CSVUtility.parse() instead of
	StringUtility.parseCSV.

2003-04-17  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/ReceiveNotificationLP.java:
	Bug #2798 -- ReceiveNotification reports notification for inappropriate PE
	Change to INFO level log message. This situation arises normally due
	to changing the disposition of Task from an Allocation or
	Expansion to a Disposition. This is a legal action and should not
	evoke an ERROR.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/ReceiveNotificationLP.java:
	Bug #2798 -- ReceiveNotification reports notification for inappropriate PE
	Print the task instead of the UID to aid in debugging.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/ReceiveTaskLP.java: 
	Bug #2718 -- Subscriptions show unchanged tasks as "changed" after restart
	When cloning, serialize in sender's context and deserialize in
	receiver's context.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/SpecialWorkflow.java: 
	Bug #2718 -- Subscriptions show unchanged tasks as "changed" after restart
	A special implementation of the Workflow interface to mark tasks
	being sent to other agents. All methods throw an
	UnsupportedOperationException since this is not a real Workflow.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/ReceiveTaskLP.java: 
	Bug #2718 -- Subscriptions show unchanged tasks as "changed" after restart
	Check if received tasks have been marked with a Workflow. If so,
	the task is cloned to avoid aliasing errors. Cloning is done using
	serialization so the resultant task is indistinguishable from one
	that was sent over the network. None of the existing task copying
	methods achieves this.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/RemoteClusterAllocationLP.java: 
	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/PreferenceChangeLP.java:
	Bug #2718 -- Subscriptions show unchanged tasks as "changed" after restart
	Mark sent tasks with a SpecialWorkflow so that aliasing errors can
	be corrected by the receiving agent.

	* org/cougaar/planning/servlet/CompletionServlet.java:
	Do a better job of determining completion by comparing to a
	(domain-defined) threshhold instead of a fixed threshhold.

	* org/cougaar/planning/plugin/util/ExpanderHelper.java:
	Separate the extraction of the "OfType" string from a task from
	the isOfType method into a getOfType method. The
	DetermineRequirmentsAbsorberPlugin needs this.

	Cosmetic and logging changes.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/RescindLP.java: 
	Bug #1096 -- Received tasks are deleted without deleting the remote Allocation
	Don't ignore deleted tasks, they must be rescinded, too, in order
	to complete their deletion.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/RemoteClusterAllocationLP.java: 
	Bug #1096 -- Received tasks are deleted without deleting the remote Allocation
	Don't send tasks from the past. This is crucial to avoiding the
	problems that ensue from not having deleted the remote Allocation.
	By not sending such tasks, they will not be accidentally
	resuscitated after being deleted.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/ReceiveTaskLP.java: 
	Bug #1096 -- Received tasks are deleted without deleting the remote Allocation
	Handle receiving a deleted task. This happens only rarely, but
	when it does, remove the task on the blackboard if it is also deleted.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/ReceiveDeletionLP.java: 
	Bug #1096 -- Received tasks are deleted without deleting the remote Allocation
	Handle case of receiving a Deletion message for a task that has
	already been rescinded by sending a Rescind marked "deleted".
	Add some logging.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/DeletionLP.java: 
	Bug #1096 -- Received tasks are deleted without deleting the remote Allocation
	Minor cosmetic changes in logging message and comments.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/PlanningDomain.java:
	Bug #1096 -- Received tasks are deleted without deleting the remote Allocation
	Construct DeletionLP and ReceiveDeletionLP with different
	arguments to match new signature.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/ReceiveAssetLP.java:
	Add agent name to log entries.

	Use the real LDM if available rather than the delegator.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/LDMServesPlugin.java: 
	Bug #1848 -- Need persistence of component hierarchy for mobile agents
	Define the delegator class.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/LDMContextTable.java: 
	Bug #1848 -- Need persistence of component hierarchy for mobile agents
	Rehydration must be possible before there are any LDM components.
	If an LDMContext is needed before any have been registered, return
	a delegator instance that delegates all operations to a real
	instance when it becomes known. The real instance is initially
	null. When a real LDM is registered, the null reference is
	replaced with the real LDM. Rehydrated Assets continue using the
	delegator.

	Usability enhancement
	Sort UniqueObjects by Type (and then by UID). This collects

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/ReceiveNotificationLP.java:
	Bug #1296 -- Removing subtasks from a workflow
	Review of this code shows an accretion of various fixes and
	patches to a number problems that have been found over time. Bug
	#1296 reports a memory problem with expansions holding onto tasks
	after they have been removed from the workflow. Changes here were
	to use a simplified interface to the workflow for aggregating the
	allocation results of subtasks and recording which tasks.
