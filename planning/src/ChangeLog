	Bug #1296 -- Removing subtasks from a workflow
	Review of this code shows an accretion of various fixes and
	patches to a number problems that have been found over time. Bug
	#1296 reports a memory problem with expansions holding onto tasks
	after they have been removed from the workflow. Changes here were
	to use a simplified interface to the workflow for aggregating the
	allocation results of subtasks and recording which tasks.
