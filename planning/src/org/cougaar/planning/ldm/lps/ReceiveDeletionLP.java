  /**
   * The deletion prototol between agents.
   * DeletionPlugin in agent B decides it can delete a task received
   *    from agent A. The task is marked as deleted and then removed.
   *    DeletionLP in agent B reacts to the remove, notes the removed
   *    task is deleted, and sends a Deletion directive to agent A.
   * ReceiveDeletionLP (here) in agent A receives the Deletion
   *    directive, marks its copy of the remoteTask as deleted.
   * Eventually our (agent A) DeletionPlugin will delete the parent
   *    task of the deleted remote task. When that happens the task
   *    will be "rescinded", but the rescind will be marked as the
   *    rescind of a deleted task.
   * Agent B handles the rescind and the task is gone.
   *
   * Anomalies:
   * 1) Agent A resends the task before receiving the Deletion. Agent
   *    B finds a deleted matching task and resends the Deletion
   *    directive (just in case, see below). 
   * 2a) Agent A restarts after receiving the Deletion, but before
   *    persisting or rescinding the deleted task. The task is
   *    rehydrated as not deleted. Normal resynchronization causes the
   *    task to be resent and a new Deletion is returned as in case 1
   *    above.
   * 2b) Agent A restarts after receiving the Deletion, but before
   *    rescinding the deleted task. Normal resynchronization does not
   *    cause the task to be resent because the task is marked
   *    deleted.
   * 3) Agent A restarts after sending the rescind and the task
   *    returns. This case is problematic because there is no record
   *    anywhere of its having been deleted. We resolve this by not
   *    sending tasks that end in the past. This means that tasks that
   *    are initially published having end times in the past will not
   *    be propagated. Such tasks are anomalous to begin with.
   * 4) Agent B restarts after sending the Deletion, but before the
   *    task is rescinded and the deleted task is restored to its
   *    undeleted state. The notification from B to A signals that the
   *    task exists and is not deleted. This is at odds with A's
   *    state. Since the task has not yet been rescinded, the deleted
   *    status is removed.
   * 5) Same as 4 except A _has_ rescinded the task. It's too late to
   *    stop the outgoing TaskRescind. B ignores it because it is
   *    marked as the rescind of a deleted task and the task is not
   *    deleted. B's notification to A causes the usual TaskRescind
   *    that is also ignored by B for the same reason.
