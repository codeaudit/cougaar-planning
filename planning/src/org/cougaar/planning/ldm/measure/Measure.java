/** Base interface for all Measure classes.
 *
 * All concrete subclasses of AbstractMeasure are required to 
 * implement the method:
 *   public static AbstractMeasure newMeasure(String s, int unit);
 * Other AbstractMeasure-level constructors may be defined, depending
 * on each the primative-types that each concrete class can handle.
 * For instance, Distance is based on a double value, so in addition to
 * the above, Distance.newMeasure(double d, int unit) will be defined.
 *
 * The allowed values of the unit specifier depends on (and is defined
 * in) each Measure type.  Example: Distance.FEET is a static final int
 * with the correct value for use in constructing Distances in Feet.
 * 
 * Each Measure class will also define a getValue(int unit) method 
 * returning whatever primitive type it is based on (usually double).
 *
 * All Measure classes are equals() comparable (exact internal value 
 * equality), define toString() (the value in a standard unit and a unit 
 * abbreviation, e.g. "4.5m"), and define hashCode() (for completeness).
 *
 * @see AbstractMeasure for base implementation class of all measures.
