/** Context is a domain-refined description of the "problem"
 * that a task a task (and perhaps other plan elements) are
 * related to when there may be multiple such problems competing
 * for resources within a single logplan.
 *
 * A Context must be Serializable and will be both persisted and
 * transferred between clusters.  Instances should be small and 
 * relatively self-contained.
 *
 * Example: in the COUGAAR domain, the Context of a task will
 * be an object which describes zero or more OPlans (e.g. their
 * UIDs or Names).
