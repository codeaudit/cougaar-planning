/**

 * A Predictor is an object intended to be available on an 
 * OrganizationalAsset which provides a prediction of how the 
 * associated remote cluster WOULD respond if it were allocated a given
 * task. The predictor should be self-contained, meaning that it should
 * not require any resources other than those of the provided task and
 * its own internal resources to provide the allocation response.
 *
 * It should be noted that a Predictor is not required for every 
 * OrganizationalAsset : some clusters will not provide Predictors.
 *
 * It is anticipated that a predictor class will be optionally specified in 
 * a cluster's initialization file (<clustername>.ini) which will allow
 * the cluster to pass an instance of the predictor embedded in the
 * OrganizationalAsset copy of itself when it hooks up with other clusters.
