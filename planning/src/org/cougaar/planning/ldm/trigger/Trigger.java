/**
 * A Trigger is an object containing information indicating an action
 * to be taken if a particular state exists among a specified set of objects.
 * The trigger contains three pieces:
 *    MONITOR - Establishes the set of objects on which to test for the state
 *    TESTER - Determines if the state exists
 *    ACTION - Performs an action on the set of objects (or other class
 *                        state info)
 *
 * The Trigger contains an Execute method which captures the logic 
 * of executing trigger actions when the monitored state exists.
