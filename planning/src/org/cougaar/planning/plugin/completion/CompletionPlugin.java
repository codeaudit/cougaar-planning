/**
 * This plugin gathers and integrates completion information from

 * completion status of the agent to another agent. This process

 * the root of the tree is reached. When the root determines that
 * completion has been acheived (or is never going to be achieved), it
 * advances the clock with the expectation that the advancement will
 * engender additional activity and waits for the completion of that
